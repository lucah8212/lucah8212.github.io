            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> For this new project, we were once again given directions by Mr. Mueller. The goal was to create your own story through GitHub by intertwining different parts of the story through links. One thing that was really helpful in understanding this was the demo we were given at the very beginning which involved the story of either waking up or ignoring your alarm which would lead to certain events such as being fired if you didn't wake up or getting a virus from using your computer at work. We were told to brainstorm any topic in which we would choose our 5 favorite, and then we would be matched with a partner. Me and Valentino chose a story about being a driver in a Monaco Grand Prix. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Right off the bat, we were told to create a web tree of what our story was going to be about and how one thing would lead to another. We did this on Google Drawings using shapes and arrows. Based on that, we would now create our own GitHub file tree with all these things that would lead to another thing.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>This project should have gone smoothly, but life happened. The first week of the project I was busy helping my dad move for 2 days which allowed me to miss important instruction on the lesson. Then in the next week, I got sick, which was the worst sickness I have ever experienced in my life. I don't want to get into too much detail, but it had me in bed and I was unable to complete any tasks. I missed 4 days of school. So, this left my partner alone and it was up to him for him to at least start the project. This did not happen so I was left with no option but to do it over break before the week late penalty which I am doing right now. Anyways, when it came to the actual project, there were minimal challenges. One thing I did struggle with was trying to link my GitHub profile without it trying to go to a different file inside the repository. At first, I did not include the "https://" when linking my GitHub profile, and it would try to link to a file inside the repository that didn't exist. </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">
                [Luca Herron](github.com/lucah8212)
            </code></pre>
            <p>This was fixed by adding that "https://" which tells the language that we are trying to go to an external link.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">
                [Luca Herron](https://github.com/lucah8212)
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>I believe that my teacher assigned this project because it allowed us to think about the things that we are passionate about and use our imagination and creativity to make something that can be interactive and enjoyable. The project also teaches us great cooperation and planning with our partners which is a key life lesson, to always think about the next step ahead.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>If I were to redo this project, I would definetely hope for it to happen at a better time. I mentioned everything above that went wrong, but I also didn't do a great job of checking in with my partner everyday about the project, where I only checked in twice. Overall, this was one of the most enjoyable projects of the year because there was tons of freedom and it was a pleasure to work with my friend.</p>
