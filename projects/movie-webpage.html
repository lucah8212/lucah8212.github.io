            <h1 class="margin text-center">The Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> Mr. Mueller gave us directions on our new project. The theme was to create an information website on a movie that either does not exist or is a sequel to an existing movie. I worked with my partner who sits next to me, which is Xin Yu. We then came to a conclusion that our movie was going to be a murder mystery and named it "Remote Menace". </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Right off the bat, we were instructed to create a plan using markdown which would essentially remind the both of us what we need to attain in the project and what our roles are. Below is a list of elements that needed to be in your project.</p>
            <li>Headers</li>
            <li>Paragraphs</li>
            <li>Div, span</li>
            <li>Custom google fonts</li>
            <li>Input and submit buttons</li><br>
            <p>The CSS requirements include</p>
            <li>Class and id selectors</li>
            <li>Use proper border, padding, margin, etc.</li> 
            <li>There also needed to be two local images on the webpage.</li>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>My partner and I were not so much focused on the visual design part and just attempted to meet the criteria (besides the fact we did not insert input & submit buttons). We did not focus on making it realistic or overly crazy. We focused on a simple design. Understanding how to use padding and margin was a big challenge when designing our webpage. The main thing that was really frustrating when designing the webpage was attempting to indent all of the text for visual purposes. At first, I could not grasp the fact that using text-align was complicated, and instead just used a basic "left" property, as shown below. </p>
            <pre><code class="language-CSS">
                left: 30px;
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ol> 
            <li>When you're doing any project, including non-school, it is always best to have a partner or even a group because this way everyone holds responsibility for their role which can ultimately lead to better production.</li>
            <li>If you don't know how to do something, try a couple times and if you still cannot get it, ask a peer or use the internet to research how to do the thing you need to do. I did this many times throughout the project.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>To make sure my project fits all the criteria I need to spend less time on the visual aspects and more on the funcionality, which would be inserting that input button. This is something that I will definetely do in the future.</p>
